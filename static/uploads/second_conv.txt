( 28s ) Visitor: hello
( 32s ) Robin J: Thank you for choosing Dell, My name is Robin. How may I assist you today?
( 1m 43s ) Visitor: I have a wax630e and we are only using port one on this unit as I have not set up the LAGs yet. and I have a user you plugged a device into port 2 of the unit which accesses our network management vlan 1
( 1m 55s ) Visitor: how can I set that port to only work on a different vlan?
( 2m 13s ) Visitor: this way he can not access our management network with a rouge device?
( 2m 27s ) Visitor: The device is insight managed
( 4m 1s ) Visitor: It is in its own location, and no other devices are in that location. When I go to wired networks it says there are no switches which is correct but I can change the tagging of the WAP ports as there is no option to do that once it is set up.
( 4m 42s ) Robin J: May I know if you created the VLANs in the network?
( 11m 20s ) Visitor: yes
( 11m 30s ) Visitor: it is there for an SSID
( 11m 42s ) Visitor: its vlan 25
( 11m 52s ) Visitor: but the nic 2 is defaulted to vlan 1
( 12m 18s ) Visitor: there is a spot to change that when setting up the device, but not after
( 13m 2s ) Robin J: Alright, let me check the details for you.
( 14m 18s ) Visitor: ok
